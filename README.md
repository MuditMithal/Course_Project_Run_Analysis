Course Project Week 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The purpose of this project is to collect, process and clean tidy data. The data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.


##run_analysis.R

This R script defines step by step process of how to process the data into tidy datasets:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##CodeBook.md

This file will explain different variables used in the script.
